# NEXT STEPS — GOLD ROGER

---

## PRODUCT VISION

**What this is**: An M&A analysis platform for funds and advisors.
Two modes:
1. **Company analysis** — enter any company (public or private), get a full memo: valuation, football field, scenarios, IC score, investment thesis, slide deck, Excel model.
2. **Deal sourcing** — enter a client investment brief, get a shortlist of real target companies with scoring, rationale, and preliminary valuation.

**Core rule (non-negotiable)**: LLMs produce language, never numbers. Every financial figure — revenue, margin, EV, multiple — must originate from a verified data source or a clearly-tagged deterministic estimate.

**LLM strategy**: Mistral by default (free). Switchable via `--llm` or `LLM_PROVIDER`. Architecture is already LLM-agnostic — no code change to switch providers.

**Data strategy**: Free tier must produce excellent analysis. Architecture is pluggable — Bloomberg, CapIQ, Refinitiv can be connected per client without touching core logic.

**UI**: CLI + `--interactive` + explicit CLI source selection (`--sources`, `--list-sources`) for now. Web interface (Next.js + FastAPI) once data layer is solid.

## WHAT WORKS TODAY

| Capability | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Full per-field provenance tracking | ✅ Done | `sources.md` logs all inputs — revenue, margins, beta, WACC, growth, EV — with source + confidence; WACC now correctly tagged `verified` when CAPM used |
| EV/EBITDA comps anchor determinism | ✅ Done | `ValuationService` now locks comps mid to live `market_data.ev_ebitda_market`; peer ranges only affect spread (capped ±25%) |
| Data quality gate (public + private) | ✅ Done | Deterministic `data_quality` score/tier with blockers/warnings now returned in analysis output and logged to `sources.md` |
| UI credential setup for missing sources | ✅ Done | API + UI now expose keyed providers and allow runtime key entry with optional `.env` persistence |
| Mandatory company confirmation flow | ✅ Done | UI and CLI now require explicit company confirmation before non-pipeline runs, with a “None of these companies” option, country-hint support, and GB Companies House candidate listing when key is set |
| CLI env/key loading parity | ✅ Done | CLI now loads `.env` at startup, and Companies House is correctly marked as key-required in source status |
| GB confirmation fallback when CH API auth fails | ✅ Done | CLI now falls back to public Companies House search HTML and still shows candidate company numbers |
| Entity identity guardrail in pipeline/thesis | ✅ Done | Confirmed company identifier now flows into analysis, GB private lookups can resolve by company number, and thesis is constrained against similarly named-company hallucinations |
| GB Companies House metadata enrichment | ✅ Done | Pipeline now ingests SIC details, active directors/officers counts, incorporation date, and recent filing-history metadata for fundamentals + thesis grounding |
| GB filing-history document ingestion | ✅ Done | Companies House provider now reads paginated filing history (bounded), indexes document metadata formats, and logs filing/document counts into analysis provenance |
| GB statement-of-capital extraction | ✅ Done | Incorporation filing PDFs are now parsed for share class, total shares, aggregate nominal value, unpaid capital, and rights summary; surfaced in metadata and `sources.md` |
| GB strict thesis grounding mode | ✅ Done | For confirmed GB entities with limited verified detail, thesis output now avoids named competitor/product/TAM speculation and uses registry facts as hard baseline |
| Strict JSON retry compatibility fix | ✅ Done | `DataCollectorAgent.run()` now accepts strict-retry kwargs, preventing crash on retry path during transient API failures |
| Public company valuation (DCF + Comps + LBO) | ✅ Solid | yfinance, CAPM WACC, sector multiples |
| Private company valuation — high-growth | ✅ Improved | DCF 20% / Comps 35% / Tx 45% weights |
| Sector-calibrated growth + margin fallbacks | ✅ Done | `get_sector_rev_growth` / `get_sector_ebitda_margin` |
| HealthTech sector multiples | ✅ Done | EV/Rev 6–20x, WACC 11.5%, growth 22% |
| IC scoring — pure numeric, no sector imports | ✅ Done | Caller passes ev_rev_sector_mid/high |
| LBO growth-equity detection | ✅ Done | EV/Revenue > 12x OR EV/EBITDA > 25x (config-driven) |
| Interactive data source selector | ✅ Done | `--interactive` — Y/N per provider, manual revenue override |
| Non-interactive source selector | ✅ Done | `--sources auto/all/name1,name2` + `--list-sources`; missing credentials auto-skip |
| Private revenue quality merge | ✅ Done | confidence-weighted provider merge + deterministic outlier rejection |
| Private recommendation labels | ✅ Done | ATTRACTIVE ENTRY / CONDITIONAL GO / SELECTIVE BUY / FULL PRICE |
| Scenario weights match engine weights | ✅ Done | `run_scenarios(weights=result.weights_used)` |
| Deterministic assumption guardrail | ✅ Done | WACC / terminal growth no longer sourced from LLM by default |
| LLM standalone revenue fallback removed | ✅ Done | no separate “guess revenue JSON” call |
| Transaction comp acceptance hardening | ✅ Done | stricter EV/year/source filters before cache inclusion |
| Thread-safe rate limiter | ✅ Done | `threading.Lock` — no more 429 races |
| JSON repair (Mistral free tier) | ✅ Done | Trailing commas, None literals, truncated output recovery |
| Wikipedia revenue signal | ✅ Done | Signal 5 in private triangulation |
| Hallucination firewall | ✅ Done | No-revenue path blocks any figure generation in thesis agent |
| EU registries (FR, UK, DE, ES, NL) | ✅ Wired | Revenue quality varies by country |
| Parallel agents | ✅ Fast | ThreadPoolExecutor, 2 workers (Mistral free tier) |
| Bear/Base/Bull scenarios + football field | ✅ Solid | Anchored to actual revenue y0, correct weights |

---

## WHAT IS BROKEN OR INSUFFICIENT

| Problem | Impact | Root cause |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Private revenue still often missing | Blocks accurate valuation | FR SAS confidentiality law; DE/ES/NL registries expose no revenue |
| Mistral free tier JSON failures | Agent output silently discarded | Token-limit truncation + non-standard JSON; repair catches most but not all |
| Transaction comps coverage still thin | Multiples can be sparse | No paid deal feed yet (Capital IQ / Refinitiv / Mergermarket) |
| PPT is text tables | Not presentable to fund clients | No charts in python-pptx |
| Excel is DCF only | Missing BS + CF | Not a real 3-statement model |
| SEC EDGAR match quality variable | US private coverage uneven | `fetch_by_name()` depends on filing-name quality and aliases |
| Company identity ambiguity from free-text names | Can fetch wrong ticker/company | Name-based resolution can return near-match symbols without user confirmation |
| IC auto-score floor ~54 for private | Requires agent data to reach BUY | Strategy/synergies neutral at 5.0 without agent intelligence |

## PRIORITY ROADMAP

### 🔴 PRIORITY 0 — Data quality (before anything else)

#### 0.0 — Fix EV volatility from LLM peer comps  ← **COMPLETED**

**Status**: ✅ completed. Comps anchor is now deterministic when live market EV/EBITDA exists.

**Root cause**: `PeerFinderAgent` returns EV/EBITDA multiples from LLM memory. These vary per run (e.g. 35.8x → 45.1x). At 40% blend weight on NVIDIA's $133B EBITDA, a 10-point multiple swing adds ~$1.3T to the output. The peer multiple is supposed to be anchored to `market_data.ev_ebitda_market` (live yfinance) but LLM-suggested overrides can bypass this.

**Implemented** in `ValuationService._standard_comps()`:
- When `market_data.ev_ebitda_market` is set, use it as the fixed mid; only allow ±25% range from peers
- Log the peer multiple source in `field_sources` so it's visible in `sources.md`
- Added regression test `tests/test_valuation_comps_anchor.py`: two runs with different peer ranges must keep blended EV within 5% (currently 0.00% in deterministic smoke test)

#### 0.1 — Private revenue confidence scoring refinement

**Status**: implemented and active.  
**Remaining work**: add country-specific weighting profiles and confidence calibration by sector.

#### 0.4 — Data quality gate and scorecard  ← **COMPLETED**

**Status**: ✅ completed.

**Implemented**:
- New deterministic gate: `goldroger/data/quality_gate.py`
- Analysis output now includes `data_quality` payload: score, tier, blockers, warnings, checks
- `equity.py` logs the quality score in console and `sources.md`
- Regression tests added: `tests/test_quality_gate.py`

**Current policy**:
- Missing revenue triggers a blocker (`is_blocked=true`) and limited-confidence warning mode
- Public checks include market data presence, market cap, live EV/EBITDA, beta
- Private checks include provider-record availability + confidence level weighting

#### 0.5 — UI/API credential entry for all keyed providers  ← **COMPLETED**

**Status**: ✅ completed.

**Implemented**:
- `GET /data-sources` returns provider capabilities/status (including missing-key status)
- `POST /settings/credentials` accepts provider env vars and values, applies at runtime
- Optional persistence to `.env` (`persist_to_env_file=true`)
- `/ui` now includes a credentials panel to enter/update keys directly

#### 0.6 — Mandatory company confirmation before analysis  ← **COMPLETED**

**Status**: ✅ completed.

**Implemented**:
- New endpoint: `GET /resolve-company?query=...&company_type=...` (returns suggested matches)
- Non-pipeline analysis now requires explicit confirmation (`confirmed_company=true`)
- UI always shows a confirmation step before run
- CLI now prompts confirmation before non-pipeline run
- CLI private confirmation now prompts for country hint and shows source/context columns
- UI and CLI include explicit **“None of these companies”** option to stop and refine safely

#### 0.2 — Crunchbase activation

**Status**: implemented, tested. Set `CRUNCHBASE_API_KEY` in `.env` to activate.
**Note**: Crunchbase removed free tier in 2024 — enterprise subscription required.
Activating it immediately covers most VC-backed private companies globally.

#### 0.3 — Companies House XBRL revenue improvement

**Status**: SIC/sector fetched. Revenue parsing is best-effort; many filings return None.
**Fix**: improve XBRL namespace handling for iXBRL inline filings (post-2020 format).

---

### 🟠 PRIORITY 1 — Transaction comps (real deal data)

**Current**: EV/Revenue multiples come from LLM M&A research — anecdotal, unverified.

**Problem**: a fund building a deal thesis needs multiples from *comparable recent transactions*, not LLM-recalled headlines. A single outlier deal (e.g. Veeva at 25x) can dominate the blended valuation.

**Needed**: a local deal cache populated from structured sources:

```
data/
  transaction_comps.json    ← local cache, updated per run
  providers/
    mergermarket.py         ← stub (requires subscription)
    press_releases.py       ← free: scrape PR Newswire + BusinessWire M&A announcements
```

**Agent behavior refinement**:
1. `TransactionCompsAgent` outputs structured JSON: `{acquirer, target, sector, ev_usd_m, revenue_usd_m, ev_rev_multiple, date}`
2. Cache deduplicated by target name + year
3. Validation: strict EV/multiple bounds + recency window + source-quality threshold
4. `ValuationService` uses median of validated cache, not raw LLM suggestion

---

### 🟠 PRIORITY 2 — Output polish (client-ready)

M&A fund clients expect outputs that look like they came from a bank.

#### 2.1 — PPT: real charts

| Slide | Current | Target |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Football field | Text table | Horizontal bar chart (bear/base/bull ranges per method) |
| DCF | Text | Waterfall: FCF bars + terminal value |
| Peer comps | Text table | Scatter: EV/EBITDA vs EBITDA margin |
| IC Score | Text table | Radar/spider chart (6 dimensions) |

All implementable with `python-pptx` chart API.

#### 2.2 — Excel: 3-statement model

Current: DCF tab only.
Target: 7-tab model:

| Tab | Content |
|-----|---------|
| `Assumptions` | Revenue CAGR, margins, WACC, exit multiple — all editable |
| `P&L` | 5-year projected income statement |
| `Balance Sheet` | Simplified |
| `Cash Flow` | Operating + investing + financing |
| `DCF` | FCF waterfall → EV → equity value |
| `LBO` | Entry/exit, debt schedule, IRR/MOIC |
| `Scenarios` | Bear/Base/Bull sensitivity matrix |

#### 2.3 — Executive summary slide

First slide: company name, recommendation, EV range, 3 key bullets, IC score badge. One page — the slide a partner reads before the full deck.

---

### 🟡 PRIORITY 3 — Deal sourcing (investment brief → target shortlist)

**Current state**: `run_pipeline()` exists but uses LLM-hallucinated company names.

**Target state**:
1. **Real company sourcing**: Crunchbase + EU registries + web search — actual companies matching brief criteria
2. **Scoring against brief**: sector fit, size fit, geography, growth profile, deal complexity, estimated EV
3. **Output**: shortlist PPT (one slide per target: overview, financials, IC score, next step)
4. **Validation**: every target verifiable via at least one data source

**New command**: `goldroger source --brief "SaaS, €50–200M EBITDA, Southern Europe" --n 10`

---

### 🟢 PRIORITY 4 — Premium data connectors

Architecture already has `DataRegistry` + `DataProvider` ABC. Adding a new source = one file in `data/providers/`.

**Priority connectors**:

| Source | Covers | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Crunchbase Pro** | Global private, VC-backed | Stub active — key required |
| **Bloomberg** | Global, all assets | Stub ready — BDP API not yet implemented |
| **Capital IQ** | Global private + transactions | Stub ready — API not yet implemented |
| **Refinitiv / LSEG** | Global M&A transactions | Not stubbed — best source for real deal comps |
| **Companies House** | 🇬🇧 UK revenue improvement | Active — XBRL parsing needs work |

**Connector SDK**: `data/providers/TEMPLATE.py` already exists. A new provider can be wired in under 2 hours.

---

### 🔵 PRIORITY 5 — Web interface

**When**: after Priority 0 + 1 (data is trusted).
**Stack**: Next.js frontend + existing FastAPI backend (`api.py`).

**MVP screens**:
1. Search bar → analysis in progress → memo page with PPT/Excel download
2. Deal sourcing form → target shortlist with scores
3. Data source config (connect Pappers, Bloomberg, etc.)
